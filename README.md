# chesstomusic
taking a pgn of a chess game and rendering it as a piece of music
.pgn is the standard text format for chess notation.
.mxl is the standard format for musical notation.
we want to be able to automatically convert .pgn to musicxml (.mxl)
chat.ai has given us a python parsing program to take .pgn to .mxl
we need help to run it as we are serious noobs.
